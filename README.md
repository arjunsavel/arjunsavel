### Hi! I'm Arjun.

I'm a third-year grad student in the Astronomy Department at UMD, College Park. This fall (2023), I'm working as a pre-doctoral fellow at the Flatiron Center for Computational Astrophysics.

I like modeling exoplanets (especially their atmospheres), open-source science, and automation.
